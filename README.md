A modern IRC client.

### Installation

- `yarn`

### Dev Setup

After installation, you can run a dev server and start the electron instance. Running on the dev server enables hot module reloading.

- `yarn dev`
- `yarn start`

Note, these are two separate processes that run indefinitely, so you'll have to run them in two terminals.
