# ElementalIRC - Argon
A modern irc client based on Electron.

## Project setup
```bash
yarn install
```

## Run in dev mode
The following two commands must be run in separate terminals, because one runs the front end build process, and the other runs Electron.

```bash
# Monitors and automatically compiles front end code.
yarn run serve

# Starts the electron side.
yarn run start
```

## Binary builds
Not available at this time.
